/**
 * Short-TTL, single-redemption tickets for Graph byte resources that expose no
 * pre-authenticated download URL of their own.
 *
 * A ticket is a capability and nothing else: it names one Graph path and one
 * account, it is redeemable once, and it expires. It carries no credential --
 * the redemption route authenticates to Graph with the server's own token, the
 * same way every tool does. Holding a ticket therefore authorises exactly one
 * authenticated GET of exactly one resource, which is the smallest grant that
 * makes an out-of-band fetch possible at all.
 *
 * Memory-only, deliberately. Persisting tickets would mean a redeemable
 * capability surviving a restart, and re-reading it from disk is a second place
 * for it to leak; a ticket outliving the process it was minted in has no
 * legitimate use when the TTL is measured in minutes.

 * validated and the path that gets fetched two different things.
 *
 * This asks that question directly rather than enumerating the ways it can happen, because
 * enumerating them kept coming up short: dot segments resolve away, a fragment never
 * reaches the wire, and TAB, LF and CR are *deleted before* dot segments resolve, so a `..`
 * split by one of them survives a segment comparison and is reassembled by the parser.
 * Round-tripping catches that class whole, including the encoded and control-character
 * spellings, and stays correct if the parser grows another normalisation.
 *
 * `//` is rejected separately. With the version prefix in front it stays an ordinary path
 * segment, so the round trip accepts it, but it is only inert for as long as the caller
 * keeps prefixing something -- without that it parses as an authority and points off-origin.

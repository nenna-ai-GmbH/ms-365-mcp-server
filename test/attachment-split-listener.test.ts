/**
 * `--attachment-port`: the attachment route on a listener of its own.
 *
 * The deployment this exists for runs `--trust-proxy-auth`, where `/mcp` reads
 * no Authorization header at all and **network reachability is the whole of the
 * authentication**. A document-conversion sidecar has to reach `/attachment` to
 * do its job; on one shared listener, reaching `/attachment` also means reaching
 * every tool the server exposes. `--attachment-port` puts the route on a second
 * Express app so a network policy can grant one without the other.
 *
 * These tests drive the real `MicrosoftGraphServer.start()` over real TCP rather
 * than rebuilding a lookalike app, because the claim under test is about what
 * `start()` mounts where, and a replica would pass whatever `start()` actually
 * did. Two of them are deliberately not "route responds" checks:
 *
 *  - the main-port case asserts the ticket is **still redeemable afterwards**.
 *    A 404 alone would also be produced by a route that ran, refused, and burnt
 *    the ticket on the way; an unburnt ticket proves the handler was never
 *    reached, which is the actual isolation property.
 *  - the attachment-port case sweeps `/mcp`, `/token`, `/`, and the OAuth
 *    discovery documents, so "the second app has nothing else on it" is checked
 *    as a property of the app rather than assumed from the one path we thought
 *    to name.
 *
 * `--attachment-port` alone is only half of it. Two ports on one wildcard bind
 * are still one reachable surface -- container network membership grants a peer
 * every port on a container -- so `--attachment-host` binds the two listeners to
 * different addresses and the cases below assert the cross-interface dials are
 * **connection-refused**, i.e. that there is no socket rather than no route.
